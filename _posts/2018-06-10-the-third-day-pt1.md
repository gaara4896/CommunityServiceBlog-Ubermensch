# Last day volunteering

This is our third day volunteering in Kechara Food Kitchen, will also be our last day volunteering for Community Service. Like first and seocnd day, we will be going to food surplus pickup from Tesco at the afternoon and food distribution at Medan Tuanku and Anjung Singgah at night. 

## Food surplus pick up from Tesco

For this week, we had been told for an earlier time, which is 1400 as oppose to the previous 1430. Beside, we also been told the Tesco that we are going and the destination for the day. Therefore, all we need to do is gather at Kechara Food Kitchen office at 1400, collect recycle bag, and head to respective Tesco. 

### Tesco Damansara

Neoh, Xytro and I go to Tesco Damansara for food pickup. We head to the destination after collecting the recycle bag from Kechara Food Kitchen office. 

After slightly more than half an hour, we reach the entrance of the loading bay of Tesco Damansara.

Few minute after waiting outside the loading bay entrance, a guard came and open up the door for us to enter. We then drive to the food collection side.

We then wait outside the food collection side and contact the Kechara person in charge. The person in charge then contact the person in charge in Tesco. Soon after that, the person in charge in Tesco open up the door and show us the food surplus that we are going to colelct.

We then start packing the food into the recycle bag that are given to us. For this week, it is not as much as last week, but there are still quite a number of food surplus.

We then load all the food surplus into the car.

Luckily, there are still barely have enough space for the third person to sit behind. We then head to our destination, which is PJ Caring Home. 

### Tesco Kepong

After collecting recycle bag, Teong and Ong head over to their designated Tesco, which is Tesco Kepong. 

They then reach Tesco Kepong in slightly more than half an hour. They went inside the Tesco and load all the food into the car. 

According to Ong, there are also lesser food surplus this week which compare to last week. 

*Fun Fact: You don't see any image in this section don't you? That is because they forget to take picture*

After finish loading all the food, they then head over to the destination, which is PJ Caring Home. 

### PJ Caring Home 

During the time we (Xytro, Neoh and me) are leaving Tesco Damansara, Teong message us through messenger saying they had done with their side and heading towards the destinaiton. Therefore, we can conclude that we heading to the destination at almost the same time.

Despite that, we reach the destination first, before Teong and Ong. 

Xytro then reverse entry into the PJ Caring Home.

We then start unloading the food from the car. These are all the food that are unloaded from our car.

After that, we start carrying all those food to the storage of PJ Caring Home so that they can unload the food into their storage and retrieve the recycle bag.

We then help them to unload the food from their car to the PJ Caring Home storage. After we finish unloading, we leave PJ Caring Home and went to eat dinner so that we can replenish energy for food distribution at Medan Tuanku and Anjung Singgah at night.
