# Pre First Day

Two day from now will be the first day we going to help out for Kechara Soup Kitchen. 

## Program

There are several program from Kechara food kitchen, but below will be what we will be involved in.

### Food surplus pick up from Tesco

Food wastage is one of the very serious problem in today world. There are tons of food wastage every single day. Imagine homeless elderly sleeping in the street, starving, have literally not enough or no food at all, meanwhile at the opposite side of the street, a restaurant staff throwing all the food surplus into the rubish bin. These food could have been make better used, which is giving it to people who need them. 

Therefore, Kechara Food Kitchen had collaborate with Tesco for donating the food surplus from Tesco to the Urban Poor family. As to my understanding, this is one part of the food bank program from Kechara Food Kitchen. It do not only solve the problem of food wastage, it too partly solve urban poor problem, satifying their survival need. 

What we are going to do is we will go to Kechara Soup Kitchen office for a briefing, and we will drive to a Tesco and collect surplus food from them. After collecting, we will sending them to Kechara Soup Kitchen. 

The briefing will start at 1400, and the period of surplus pick up will be from 1430 to 1800.

### Food distribution at Medan Tuanku or Anjung Singgah

Kechara Food Kitchen also have food distribution program which distribute food to homeless people on the street. From what I understand, we will be going around in either on of the area mention in the title, distribute food to homeless people whenever we saw. 

The briefing will start at 1830, and the period of food distribution will be from 2000 to 2230.

## Additional
