# Last day last part

Welcome back to the third day part 2. I am afraid to say that this will be the last volunteering post already. There might be afterword, but that will really depends on how much time I have. 

## Going back

In part one, we had finish food surplus pickup from Tesco. What we did is we seperate into 2 group and went to respective Tesco, namely Tesco Damansara and Tesco Kepong. We then dispatch the food to PJ Caring Home. We then went to eat dinner after finishing it. 

After that, we went back to Kechara Food Kitchen office to give them back the document that we had collected from Tesco and the recycle bag that we had retrieve. 

Just like last week, we had been told that we will be volunteering in Anjung Singgah today. So, we went to Anjung Singgah after passing them the document and recycle bag. 

In this week, we had planned to volunteering with another group of friend from the same course with us. Before we reach the destination, we do not know if they will be assigned to the same station with us or different. The result will be reveal in the latter part of this blog. 

## Anjung Singgah

We reach Anjung Singgah around 20 minute from Kechara Food Kitchen office. During the route, we had realize that KL Tower had open up thier RGB light. 

After we reach Anjung Singgah, we saw the other group of friend had reach the destination. We then greet and talk to each other while waiting for it to start.

From the image, we can see they are stacking the table in order to create a barrier to block people from going into the food distribution area. 

### Assign of job scope

After setting up, it is the time for assigning job scope. Because 5 of us went last week and the senior recognize us, we are being assigned to the same job again. Teong and I being assigned to the authentication booth again and the rest are being assigned to assist food distribution. 

Meanwhile, there are few other group of people who are new and being brief for their job scope.

### Authentication booth

Teong and I went to the authentication booth after being assigned with the same job scope with last week. Teong will be responsible for checking client data in the computer and I will be responsible for searching client card and their registration form if incomplete. Meanwhile, one of the person from other group are being assigned to our booth to control the queue. 

### Food distribution

Neoh, Ong and Xytro then went to the food distribution booth. Different from last week, there are another group of NGO helping out today. They will be standing inside and pack the food. Meanwhile, Neoh, Ong and Xytro will be standing outside, checking their Kechara card and give them food accordingly.
