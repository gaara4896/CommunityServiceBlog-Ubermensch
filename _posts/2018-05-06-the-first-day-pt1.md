# Activities

Yesterday is the first day we volunteer work in Kechara Food Kitchen. It's been a long and tiring day, nevertheless also a meaningful day. 

## Gather

There is a total of 3 cars we use to go Kechara Food Kitchen office, which located in Jalan Imbi. I (Tony) carpool with Xytro (Cham She Kun), Eldrick (Ong Zhu Siang) carpool with Teong (Hock Lean) while Neoh (Wei) went alone. 

Prior the day we had agree to meet at the venue at 1330. Neoh Wei reach earliest, Xytro and I reach the second. Both of us do not know where is the venue and we park quite far away from the venue, so we ask Neoh to share live location and we follow the live location to reach the designated location. Ong and Teong reach at some time after it. 

## Food surplus pick up from Tesco

### Briefing

During the briefing, we are brief with our responsibilities. The whole process will be summarize below.

1. Briefing (First time)

1. Collect recycle bag

1. Drive to designated Tesco (Tesco Damansara and Tesco Kepong for our case)

1. Went into loading bay and contact person in charge.

1. Collect the food from their rack into recycle bag. 

1. Check and sign 2 document (Merchandize checkout document and deliver document)

1. Deliver it to designated location (Puchong)

There are 2 Tesco which we need to go, so we seperate into 2 cars and each go to one Tesco. Neoh and I will go Tesco Kepong and the rest go to Tesco Damansara. We then depart from the location after collecting recycle bag.

### Tesco Damansara

Ong, Teong and Xytro went to Xytro car and depart from the location. As Xytro are not familiar with the direction, the uses Waze to lead them to the destination. 

*Fun Fact: They went to the wrong route as much as 4 times before reaching the destination*

Finally, they reach the loading bay of the Tesco Damansara. It is raining at that time.

They then start loading all the food into the recycle bag that had given to us. There had been a lot of food that needed for them to load, so it took them quite a while to do that. Fianlly, everything had been loaded to the car.

The whole car is full of food now. 

They then depart from Tesco Damansara and go to the destinated location in Puchong.

### Tesco Kepong

Neoh and I also depart to Kepong Tesco with Neoh's car. Both of us use Waze too because both of us are not familiar with the direction. 

*One shalt not imagine life without Waze*

**Some fun fact** 

*Durign the journey to the Kepong Tesco, I play with Neoh's car player which comes with the bluetooth. I pair it with my device and try to play some song from Spotify. The integration of Spotify with the player is so good that it will show the song name in the player and it can control previous or next song from the player.*

Finally we had reach the Kepong Tesco.

We had been told by the person in charge to wait for a while. So we wait there for around 10-20 minutes. 

Finally they come out with the food that needed to deliver. We then do the same thing, which is pack them into the recycle bag and load it into the car.

The food from Tesco Kepong are relatively lesser than the amount of food from Tesco Damansara. Could it be pure luck or faith had lead us to the Tesco with lesser food? If we went to the Tesco Damansara, the car might not be big enough to fetch. 

We then depart from Tesco Kepong to the same destination with the other group. 

### Puchong destination

Finally both of us had reach the destination and unload all the food to the person in charge.

There are so many surplus food from Tesco every single day. Imagine if Tesco would not had collaborate with Kechara Food Kitchen, all of these food which are still consumeable would went to waste. Sometimes, solving a issue does not necessary mean that we need to solve it in the global scale, by these two parties simply collaborating with each other, numbers of people had benefited from it and hence creating a happier and better world.
