# The Second Discussion

As we have decided and agreed on what to do for our community service, we move on to planning the schedule of our visit with Kechara Soup Kitchen. 

## Aim of This Service

Through volunteering for this activity, we can help those in hunger by collecting and distributing foods that are of surplus from markets to these people.

## What We're Going To Do

We will be collecting surplus of foods from market like Tesco and distribute these foods to homeless people in certain streets such as at Medan Tuanku or Anjung Singgah. By doing this, we are able to help those that are unable to go to a charity centre.

## Work to done

Tomorrow is the deadline of proposal, and the progress of proposal is already 80%. We will submit it either tonight or tomorrow. 

# Kechara Soup Kitchen

Kechara is a Tsem Rinpoche organization that aims to provide sustenance and basic medical care for homeless and urban poor in Malaysia. Founder of Kechara Soup Kitchen was inspired to help those in need as he himself has experienced hunger and knew how it felt to have no shelter to live in.
