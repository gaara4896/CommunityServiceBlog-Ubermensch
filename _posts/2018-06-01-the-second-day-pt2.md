# Part 2

Welcome back to the second volunteer day part 2. Tomorrow will be our last day volunteering with Kechara Food Kitchen. 

It's been a few day since we update part 1, and we had cover Food Surplus pick up from Tesco, and we will be covering what happen on that night, which is Food distribution at Medan Tuanku and Anjung Singgah. 

## Going back

In part one, we had collected the food from various Tesco and fetch it to PJ Caring Home. After that, we went back to Kechara Food Kitchen office to pass them several document involved during collection of food and also the recycle bag that mention in part one. 

Different from last week, we do not need to go through briefing because this is our second time volunteering for Food distribution at Medan Tuanku and Anjung Singgah. Also different from first day, we had been told that we are assigned to Anjung Singgah few day before our second day. 

After passing the document and recycle bag to the office, we go to have our dinner. 

## Anjung Singgah

After our dinner, we went to Anjung Singgah. When we reach the destination, we saw there are few other volunteer from other university, which is Inti University.

They wear Inti University uniform and standing there discussing with each other. We then approach by a senior volunteer and been told that we will be assigned with job scope in a while. 

### Assign of job scope

We had cover some job scope available last time, so I will not cover it again. This time, Teong and I are assigned for authentication booth while Xytro, Neoh and Teong are being assigned to food distribution booth. 

### Setup

### Authentication booth

Teong and I went to authentication booth. There is a senior at the booth, and he is responsible to communicate directly with the client. Teong are responsible to check the client database and I am repsonsible to look for their card and check the incomplete file. 

What happen is basically when any client do not have the Kechara card with them, they are directed to the booth. The senior will ask them for their IC or similar document and Teong will type their IC number in the computer to search for their information. If found, they will be given a temporary card to receive food or receive doctor treatment. I will also look for their card if they had not receive their card before. 

However, if their name is not found, they will be asked if they had register before. The senior will then direct them accordingly. The senior will also direct them to other place accordingly if he found that they had lost their card so they can reissue a new card. 

### Food distribution

Food distribution booth are fairly simple. Neoh, Ong and Xytro stand at the food distribution booth. Food distribution function in a pipeline.

At the begining, Neoh will check their card, can be either temporary card or Kechara card. Then they will move Ong, which will give them a box of rice and a bread. After that, they will move on to Xytro which will give them some biscuit. 

### Wrapping Up

Finally, the day had come to an end. All of us start wrapping up the venue and we then go back to our home.
