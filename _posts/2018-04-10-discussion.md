# The first discussion

After we form our group, we discuss about some ideas of where we might going to do.

## Suggestion

### Animal Shelter

Cham She Kun suggest to go to animal shelter. The reason is because he like dog. So we quickly google search and found a few that are in KL area, which is 

1. [PAWS Animal Welfare Society](http://www.paws.org.my/)

1. Furry Friends Farm

1. Lost Animal Souls Shelter (LASS)

### Education

Ng Wei Shyang then suggested to go to orphanage to teach something tech related, such as programming skills. We aware that there aren't any computer in orphanage, but it can be done by teaching some basic logic without using computer. We believe that programming is more than just a tools to bbuild software, but it also helps to develop some important skills such as problem solving skills, logic, etc. 

### Food distribution

This is a bit funny because we then open the slides in elearn, and we saw soup-kitchen as one of the option. So we also to take this option into consideration.

## Work to done

Each of us has given task to contact these organization that had been taken into consideration. 

## The next meeting

We decided to not have physical meeting anymore, but instead communicate through online. 

The end.
