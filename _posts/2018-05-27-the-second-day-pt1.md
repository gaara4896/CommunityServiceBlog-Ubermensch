# Day 2

We had went to volunteer work again at Kechara Food Kitchen yesterday. It's been some time since the first day because some of our member went back to hometown during the semester break. Since this is the second week, we do not need to briefing again anymore. The volunteer work that we volunteer yesterday is the same with the first day, which is food surplus pick up from Tesco and food distribution at Medan Tuanku or Anjung Singgah. 

## Gather

All of us decided to gather at the entrance of the Kechara Food Kitchen office at 1430 the day prior to yesterday. All 5 of us reach the destination on time. 

## Food surplus pick up from Tesco

After we being told the Tesco that we are heading and the destination of the day, we collect the recycle bag and head to our respective Tesco being assigned. 

The Tesco that are assigned for us is Tesco Kepong and Tesco Damansara. According to our previous experience, Tesco Damansara has more food surplus and would need more people, so Xytro, Neoh and me went to Tesco Damansara while Ong and Teong went to Tesco Kepong. 

### Tesco Damansara



### Tesco Damansara

Ong, Teong and Xytro went to Xytro car and depart from the location. As Xytro are not familiar with the direction, the uses Waze to lead them to the destination. 

*Fun Fact: They went to the wrong route as much as 4 times before reaching the destination*

Finally, they reach the loading bay of the Tesco Damansara. It is raining at that time.

They then start loading all the food into the recycle bag that had given to us. There had been a lot of food that needed for them to load, so it took them quite a while to do that. Fianlly, everything had been loaded to the car.

The whole car is full of food now. 

They then depart from Tesco Damansara and go to the destinated location in Puchong.

### Tesco Kepong

Neoh and I also depart to Kepong Tesco with Neoh's car. Both of us use Waze too because both of us are not familiar with the direction. 

*One shalt not imagine life without Waze*

**Some fun fact** 

*Durign the journey to the Kepong Tesco, I play with Neoh's car player which comes with the bluetooth. I pair it with my device and try to play some song from Spotify. The integration of Spotify with the player is so good that it will show the song name in the player and it can control previous or next song from the player.*

Finally we had reach the Kepong Tesco.

We had been told by the person in charge to wait for a while. So we wait there for around 10-20 minutes. 

Finally they come out with the food that needed to deliver. We then do the same thing, which is pack them into the recycle bag and load it into the car.

The food from Tesco Kepong are relatively lesser than the amount of food from Tesco Damansara. Could it be pure luck or faith had lead us to the Tesco with lesser food? If we went to the Tesco Damansara, the car might not be big enough to fetch. 

We then depart from Tesco Kepong to the same destination with the other group. 

### Puchong destination

Finally both of us had reach the destination and unload all the food to the person in charge.

There are so many surplus food from Tesco every single day. Imagine if Tesco would not had collaborate with Kechara Food Kitchen, all of these food which are still consumeable would went to waste. Sometimes, solving a issue does not necessary mean that we need to solve it in the global scale, by these two parties simply collaborating with each other, numbers of people had benefited from it and hence creating a happier and better world.
