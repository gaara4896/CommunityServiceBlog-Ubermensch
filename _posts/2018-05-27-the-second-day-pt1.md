# Day 2

We had went to volunteer work again at Kechara Food Kitchen yesterday. It's been some time since the first day because some of our member went back to hometown during the semester break. Since this is the second week, we do not need to briefing again anymore. The volunteer work that we volunteer yesterday is the same with the first day, which is food surplus pick up from Tesco and food distribution at Medan Tuanku or Anjung Singgah. 

## Gather

All of us decided to gather at the entrance of the Kechara Food Kitchen office at 1430 the day prior to yesterday. All 5 of us reach the destination on time. 

## Food surplus pick up from Tesco

After we being told the Tesco that we are heading and the destination of the day, we collect the recycle bag and head to our respective Tesco being assigned. 

The Tesco that are assigned for us is Tesco Kepong and Tesco Damansara. According to our previous experience, Tesco Damansara has more food surplus and would need more people, so Xytro, Neoh and me went to Tesco Damansara while Ong and Teong went to Tesco Kepong. 

### Tesco Damansara

3 of us then depart form the venue to Tesco Damansara. We open up the Waze and follow the route being assigned by Waze and play some music from Spotify. Some of the road are having traffic jam due to the rain, so it took us some time to reach the destination. 

After slightly more than half an hour, we reach the entrance of the loading bay of Tesco Damansara.

Due to the rain, the guard is not beside the entrance. So, we contact the Kechara person in charge. few minute later, the guard came and open the gate for us.

The person in charge then open up the gate from the inside of shopping mall towards the loading bay to let us collect the food surplus.

All of those green basket are filled with food surplus. We then fill up the recycle bag provided by Kechara Food Kitchen we the food in those basket. There's a lot of food surplus, so much so that it is more than our car can fit. At the end, there are 3 basket left which we are unable to load it into our car.

The Kechara person in charge then tell us that they will have people collect the rest today (one day after our second day volunteering at Kechara Food Kitchen).

The car is now loaded with full of food. We then depart from the Tesco Damansara and head over to our destination, which is PJ Caring Home. 

### Tesco Kepong

### PJ Caring Home 

Both of our team navigate to the destination by using Waze. Unfortunately, the destination are not exactly at the destination indicate by Waze, but it is few road across from the destination indicated by Waze. We found it out by asking the Kechara person in charge. The person in charge give us the address of PJ Caring Home and we are able to find it after around 10 minutes. 

We then take turn to reverse enter our car into PJ Caring Home to unlaod the food. 

First, we unlaod the food from the car and place it near the front entrance of PJ Caring Home.

We then move the food to the entrance of the backend area (by using backend, I mean by all the work are done there, which include storing and preparing food).

Depending on the food type, it will be move to different places. For type of food which can be consume directly such as bread or donuts, it will be unloaded at the table beside the area where we place the food. 

From the image, we can see Teong is unloading the bread with a old lady from the PJ Caring Home. 

Anything other than that, such as raw food, it will be move to the entrance of the storage.

They then unload the food into the storage and return us the recycle bag.
